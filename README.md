### Build your Ralph
You should have a chassis with a lithium battery, charging circuit and 5V booster & switch already attached. The circuitry looks after charging the battery (and cutting out when it gets too low) and converting its output volage (~3.8V) to 5V as required by the Arduino. There should be two red and two brown wires coming out of the 5V booster circuit. The red wires are 5V and the brown ones are Ground. One pair will power the motor driver while the other will power the arduino.


1. Attach the motors to the chassis with cable ties. 
2. Connect the wires from the motors to the motor driver using the screw mounts.
